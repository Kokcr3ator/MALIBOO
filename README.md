# MALIBOO
MALIBOO (MAchine Learning In Bayesian OptimizatiOn) is a Python library which performs Bayesian Optimization (BO) on black-box functions, or on their tabular representation.
The implemented BO algorithms are integrated with Machine Learning techniques.

This library originates as a fork from the [BayesianOptimization](https://github.com/fmfn/BayesianOptimization) package from Fernando Nogueira [(@fmfn)](https://github.com/fmfn), started in 2014.
