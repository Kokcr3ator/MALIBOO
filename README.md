# MALIBOO
MALIBOO (MAchine Learning In Bayesian OptimizatiOn) is a Python library which performs Bayesian Optimization (BO) on black-box functions, or on their tabular representation.
The implemented BO algorithms are integrated with Machine Learning techniques.

This library originates as a fork from the [BayesianOptimization](https://github.com/fmfn/BayesianOptimization) package from Fernando Nogueira ([@fmfn](https://github.com/fmfn)), started in 2014.

## Tutorial
Please check the [`main_examples.py`](https://github.com/brunoguindani/BayesianOptimization/blob/master/main_example.py) file for over 20 usage examples.

## Tutorial / Base documentation
Coming soon™️. In the meantime, please refer directly to the well-documented [Python files](https://github.com/brunoguindani/BayesianOptimization/tree/master/bayes_opt) of the project.
